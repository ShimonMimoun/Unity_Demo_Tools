# Unity Example Code



## Collision

The modifications to the official version are located in the Scene 

***Path :***

    ..//Collision/Assets/Scenes/homwork-shield.unity

I added two functions to the official version of [@erelsgl](https://github.com/erelsgl-at-ariel/gamedev-5780-code)

 1.  The player cannot fire lasers without a break, but must wait a certain time (say, half a second). The next shot which can be rotated thanks to the delay variable

 2. The possibility of playing with two players on the same games:
	 - The first player uses the arrows to move and Space to shoot
	-  The second player uses the A_W_D_S and Q keys to shoot



## Limit 
***Path :***

    ..//Limit/1 or ..//Limit/2 or ..//Limit/3

Remember, one of the official components of every game is boundaries. By default, World Unity Games is
Infinite and flat. Show how to use colliders to create boundaries in the spacecraft, so the world will
1. A flat world with visible boundaries, such as walls that cannot be crossed;

2. A flat world with invisible borders; For example, when the enemies go through the bottom of the screen, they are
Destroyed; As the laser goes through the top of the screen - it is destroyed.

3. Round World - When the player reaches one side of the world, he appears on the other side.
