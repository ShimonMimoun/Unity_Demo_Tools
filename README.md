# Unity Example Code



## Collision

The modifications to the official version are located in the Scene 


> path://Collision/Assets/Scenes/homwork-shield.unity
***

I added two functions to the official version of [@erelsgl]
(https://github.com/erelsgl-at-ariel/gamedev-5780-code)

 1.  The player cannot fire lasers without a break, but must wait a certain time (say, half a second). The next shot

 2. The possibility of playing with two players on the same games:
	 - The first player uses the arrows to move and Space to shoot
	-  The second player uses the A_W_D_S and Q keys to shoot



## Some examples of using Unity functions.
